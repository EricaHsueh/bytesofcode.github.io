<h2> Which fruit would I be?</h2>
    <p> If I were to be a fruit, I would choose to be a strawberry.
    Strawberries are sweet, and are a great source of vitamin C. 
    One of my favorite colors are red, which is why this is a fruit
    I would like to be. In another perspective, strawberries are one
    of the many fruits that people love, and they are delicious!</p>
