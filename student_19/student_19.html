    <h2>Favorite flavor of ice cream</h2>

      <li>Chocolate Mint</li>
      <li>Strawberry</li>

    <h4>Food that I don't like very much</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetables in general. Some notable ones are as follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Brussel Sprouts</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fruit I'd like to be</h2>
    <p>A peach would be what I'd like. As a summer fruit, I would receive some of the warmest rays of the sun, which would allow me to grow to be
        bigger and juicier. Also, the amount of juice and sweetness in it allows the consumer to actually enjoy the taste of it, which would
        be satisfactory for me too as I would know that I had accomplished my goal of being something nutricious and bringing joy to the eater. </p>
