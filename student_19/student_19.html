    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <h2>Favorite flavor of ice cream</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chocolate Mint</li>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Food that I don't like very much</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetables in general. Some notable ones are as follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Brussel Sprouts</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fruit I'd like to be</h2>
    <p>A peach would be what I'd like. As a summer fruit, I would receive some of the warmest rays of the sun, which would allow me to grow to be
        bigger and juicier. Also, the amount of juice and sweetness in it allows the consumer to actually enjoy the taste of it, which would
        be satisfactory for me too as I would know that I had accomplished my goal of being something nutricious and bringing joy to the eater. </p>

    <h2>Three Places I'd Like to Go</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class = "places" >Antarctica</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite the fact I fear the cold</li>
      </ul>
      <li class = "places">The Moon</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If money was never a problem, I would love to go there as I would want to see the view of the Earth from a different standpoint
          and understand what people mean when they call Earth the blue planet</li>
      </ul>
      <li class = "places">Alaska</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Again, it's ironic why I would do so since I fear the cold. However, I want to be able to witness the natural pheonomenon of the 
            Northern Lights. And if I go to Antarctica to see the Southern Lights, I might as well see it from both poles. </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Additional Q&A's</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Favorite song as of right now?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Probably Rosalina's Storybook. It's not a real song though. It's a video game soundtrack but it's extremely melancholy and
          makes me feel different feelings at once: those of bitterness and hopefulness</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Favorite music artist?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Piano Guys. I don't care if they don't count as a music artist. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Favorite book?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Catcher in the Rye. It's cynical take on life despite the narrator's naivety is eye-opening</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If someone shaved off one of your eyebrows, would you shave the other one off or would you draw one on?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I'd just shave it off. Drawing eyebrows everyday would be extremely frustrating for me.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
