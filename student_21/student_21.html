  <h2> Favorite Ice cream flavor</h2>
  <body>
    My favorite flavor of ice cream would either be chocolate fudge brownie or cookie dough. my most favorite brand would most likely be Ben and Jerry's because they have such creative flavors like cinnamon bun which is also very good.
    <h3>One food I don't like very much is...</h3>
    brussel sprouts because they have lack of flavor and have an unpleasing texture but I still have to eat them sadly.
    <h2>If I were a fruit...</h2>
    <p> I would like to be a mango because if people dont like me outside they might like the inside because I am bright and juicy on the inside. </p>
