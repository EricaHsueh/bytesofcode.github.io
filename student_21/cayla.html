HIIIII!

  <h2>This is my second page of my great website! I wanna share my passion of coding with the world which is why I made this website I hoped it affected everyone's life and made it great!  </h2>

  <h1> School Starting </h1></head>

<bodyï¼ž Summer is very fun but it is coming to an end so I'm sad but also very happy because I get to see all of my friends again. My favorite part of school is seeing my friends and learning english/core other than that it is not my favorite.
  <h1>Coding Camp</h1>   
   I had a lot of fun at this camp and i am very happy that i decide to come. My favorite things that we have done are the spheros because it was interactive and we got to use a robot that I have never used before. Also, learning about HTML and CSS has been very interesting because now i can make my own websites and dig a bit deeper into coding! :)
