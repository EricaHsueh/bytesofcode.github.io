  <h1> Welcome to Maryjo's First Website</h1>
  <h2>Favorite Flavor of Icecream</h2>
  <p> My favorite flavor of icecream would have to be cookie dough or chocolate chip brownie. As the rich flavor melts in my mouth, I become baffled by the taste and easily want more.</p>
  <h3>Least Favorite Food</h3>
  <p> My least favorite food is cheese. As a child, I had always despised the cheese smell, taste, and appearance.</p>
  <h2>If I Could Be a Fruit...</h2>
  <p>If I could be a fruit I would be a just have to be a watermelon because I never open up to people and when I open up to you I'm either end up being good or bad. :) </p>
